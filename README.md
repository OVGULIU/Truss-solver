This MATLAB code takes the input from a standard Abaqus input file of a 2D truss structure, solves for the nodes’ displacements and elements’ axial stresses. Post-processing includes calculating the maximum tensile and compressive stress in the structure, identifying the elements under those stresses, and producing plots that give a clear visual understanding of the structure. The project’s code is broken into many smaller methods that allow extending the project to include other elements, or to be reused by other projects.

Compatible with MATLAB 2017 and above.
